üì∏ CLIP Prefix Captioning:

AI-Powered Image Caption Generator
Generate natural language descriptions for any image with this powerful AI application. This project leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's CLIP for robust image understanding and a transformer-based language model (GPT-2) for fluent, human-like text generation.

This repository provides two user-friendly interfaces: a Streamlit app (main.py) and a Gradio app (test.py).

‚ú® Features

AI-Powered Captioning:Automatically generate descriptive and contextually relevant captions for images.

Dual Model Support: Choose between two pretrained weight sets:

MS-COCO: Best for common objects, people, and specific scenes.

Conceptual Captions: Ideal for more abstract, artistic, or diverse web-scale images.

Interactive UI: Upload an image and receive a caption in real-time through a simple web interface.

Transformer Architecture: Built on a sophisticated model that maps visual prefixes from CLIP into the latent space of a powerful language model.

üîß How It Works

The model works by creating a bridge between the visual world (understood by CLIP) and the language world (understood by GPT-2).

Image Encoding: An image is fed into the CLIP ViT-B/32 model, which converts it into a rich numerical representation (embedding).

Prefix Mapping: This visual embedding is then projected into the latent space of the GPT-2 model using a custom MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron). This projected embedding acts as a "prefix" or a starting context for the language model.

Caption Generation: The GPT-2 model takes this visual prefix and generates a coherent, descriptive caption word by word, conditioned on the image's content.

Excellent! Here is the updated README with your specific repository link.

I've replaced the placeholder clone URL with your actual repository link. You can now copy this entire block and paste it into your README.md file on GitHub.

Note on the Live Demo: The "Live Demo" link is still a placeholder. You'll need to deploy your application (either main.py or test.py) to a hosting service like Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud to get a public URL to put there.


‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

Git

2. Clone the Repository

Dash

git clone https://github.com/Villain-vvr/CLIP-image-captioning.git
cd CLIP-image-captioning

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate


4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages using the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Application


You have two options to run the interface:

To run the Streamlit App:

Bash

streamlit run main.py
To run the Gradio App:

Bash

python test.py

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal.
